A grid-based fluid simulator with vorticity confinement, with most computations done on the GPU. On my machine, the simulation runs at 60 fps. There are a large number of things that could be improved, such as using different sized buffers for the various fields (e.g. temperature doesn't need to be as fine as velocity). Also, there are some things that could be done to optimize the pipeline.
